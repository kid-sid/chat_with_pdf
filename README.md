# Chat with your own PDF

You must have came across [chatpdf](www.chatpdf.com) where you can upload your pdf and ask questions to get answers from your PDF file. This repo contains the implementation of a chat bot like chatpdf.com using streamlit as the frontend.

This code contains RAG architecture which takes your PDF texts as the context and provides answers to your queries.

## **Overview of the architecture**
